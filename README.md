# resume

- `pip install markdown`
- edit `readme.md` as the basis for the resume
- run `make resume` to build html and pdf versions `index.html` and `__first_h1_markdown_most_likely_your_name__.pdf`
- or `make publish` to push to github as well

You can turn on github pages to automatically serve the resume which is compile to `index.html`
